                  Our story begins in Edison, New Jersey, where Elena and Brendt have lived their entire lives. They went to the same elementary school, but did not meet there. They went to the same middle school, but did not meet there either. They went to the same high school, and on the first day of senior year they finally met. Brendt approached Elena sitting at a lunch table with her friend.

                <p>
                  “I have nowhere to sit, can I sit here”, he said
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Okay”, she replied.

                  They quickly realized how their situations allowed them to help each other. Brendt, who shared the same math class only earlier, would give Elena heads up on any quizzes or homework they received. Elena, who shared the same taste in sandwiches only pickier, would give Brendt her leftover crusts in exchange.

                <p>
                  They also had a gym class with Sebastian and Thinh. This symbiotic relationship would be the foundation of a friendship the likes of which neither had ever envisioned. By the end of the year they were best friends. The road to romance, however, was much less obvious.

                  Soon the time to choose colleges came, and the two stopped seeing each other as much. It wasn’t until senior year of college that the dynamic duo had reunited. At an all time low in morale, they reached out to each other, yearning for the good ol’ days. They started hanging out and watching The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, one of their favorite shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What started as a weekly hangout soon became daily. The two became an inseparable pair that would find each other at any chance they had. Before work, after work, even during their lunch breaks at the mall the two would run over and meet in the center for 15 minutes to eat. It wasn’t long after that they both came to a realization. Their friend-love had become a more-than-friend-love.

                  “Uh so I guess we’re dating now huh?” Brendt said.
                  “Yeah I think so,” Elena replied.
                  “Cool,” he nodded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since then, not much has changed. They still do the same goofy stuff, but in an apartment and with a cat and rabbits. Now they’re getting married. What adventures await these two? Who knows what else the future holds? Probably a dog.
