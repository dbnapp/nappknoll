                  Our story begins in Edison, New Jersey, where Elena and Brendt have lived their entire lives. They went to the same elementary school, but did not meet there. They went to the same middle school, but did not meet there either. They went to the same high school, and on the first day of senior year they finally met. Brendt approached Elena sitting at a lunch table with her friend.

                "I have nowhere to sit. Can I sit here?" he asked.
              </p>
              <p class="line-small">
                "Okay," she replied.

                They quickly realized how their situations allowed them to help each other. Brendt, who shared the same math class only earlier, would give Elena a heads up on any quizzes or homework they received. Elena, who shared the same taste in sandwiches only pickier, would give Brendt her leftover sandwich crusts in exchange.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the end of the year they were best friends. The road to romance, however, was much less obvious.

                Soon the time to choose colleges came, and the two stopped seeing each other as much. It wasn’t until senior year of college that the dynamic duo had reunited. At an all time low in morale, they reached out to each other, yearning for the good ol’ days. They started hanging out and watching The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, one of their favorite shows.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a weekly hangout soon became daily. The two became an inseparable pair that would find each other at any chance they had. Before work, after work, even during their lunch breaks at the mall, the two would run over and meet in the center for 15 minutes to eat. It wasn’t long after that they both came to a realization: their friend-love had become a more-than-friend-love.

                "Uh so I guess we’re dating now huh?" Brendt said.

              <p class="line-small">
                "Yeah I think so," Elena replied.
              </p>
              <p class="line-small">
                "Cool," he nodded.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then, not much has changed. They still do the same goofy stuff, but in an apartment with a cat and rabbits. Now they’re getting married. What adventures await these two? Who knows what else the future holds? Probably a dog.

              <p>Elena plopped down at a lunch table with a new friend, too shy to ask the other kids if she could join them. Brendt comes along with his new friend, sees the nearly empty table, and asks to join the lonely antisocial affair. Elena says “Yes”. Everyone was too antisocial to talk. It was awkward. The dynamic duo is born.</p>

              <p>Brendt and Elena have the same math class, but at different times. Brendt has it first, and shares math class intel with mathematically challenged Elena at the lunch table, in exchange for her PB&J sandwich crusts. (She still hates crust.) They were super close friends by the end of the year. Elena still can’t do math, and Brendt still eats all of her crust. (Sandwich crust, pizza crust…)</p>

              <p>Time for college (ugh). They’re really busy and barely speak anymore. Senior year comes along, and the two yearn for the good ol’ days. Enter The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air marathons, video games, ramen, and boxed wine. They both start working at Woodbridge Mall, and spend more and more time with one another. Are they dating now? Nope. But the summer of 2013 was the best summer of their lives.

              <p>They’re dating now. Whoa, when did that happen? Not sure. But it’s happening, and it’s amazing. It’s comfortable, it’s fun, and it’s effortless. And, it is also love. They’re in love now. (Gross.)</p>
              <p>He moves in with the Knolls and their zoo. The Knolls love him and he loves them – this is going well. More ramen, more video games – could this get any better? Yes. Because then Brendt and Elena get an apartment with their rabbits. Now what? More ramen, more video games.</p>

              <p>Brendt proposes at their Christmas party! (Sweet!) Elena says “Yes,” and maybe she ugly cries a little when everyone goes home. What’s the first step to wedding planning? Rescue a very fat cat named Stefan. (We do things differently here.) Now that that’s done, it’s time to rally up our loved ones and put them in a large room with loud music and an open bar! (That’s where you come in, you’re one of those people.)
